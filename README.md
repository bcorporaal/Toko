# Toko: expanding p5.js

** Work in progress **

Some handy duct tape to expand p5.js with Tweakpane, chroma.js, color palettes, p5 SVG, and more.

Features:
- Easy saving capturing options for images and video
- Switching between canvas sizes
- Larger canvas sizes are scaled to fit on the screen
- Tweakpane integration
- Large collection of color palettes
- Easy selection and usages of (custom) color palettes
- Saving and loading (through drag and drop on the canvas) of sketch parameters

sketch.js is a more extensive example, while sketch-template.js is a more minimal boilerplate for your own project.

To do:
- [ ] Add grid generator
- [ ] Make sure all random functions in Toko can be seeded

See assets/toko/source for details.
