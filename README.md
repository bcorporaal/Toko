# Toko: expanding p5.js

** Work in progress **

Some handy duct tape to expand p5.js with Tweakpane, chroma.js, color palettes, p5 SVG, and more.

Features:
- Easy saving capturing options for images and video
- Switching between canvas sizes
- Larger canvas sizes are scaled to fit on the screen
- Tweakpane integration
- Large collection of color palettes
- Easy selection and usage of (custom) color palettes
- Saving and loading (through drag and drop on the canvas) of sketch parameters

sketch.js is a more extensive example, while sketch-template.js is a more minimal boilerplate for your own project.

See assets/toko/source for details.

To do (in no particular order):
- [ ] Add grid generator
- [ ] Add option to include all collections in palette selection
- [ ] Make sure all random functions in Toko can be seeded
- [ ] Generate contrast colors based on entire palette
- [ ] Update color palettes
- [ ] Add gradients for shapes
- [ ] add meta data to each collection so not every palette needs all info
- [ ] change 'type:' into 'collection:'
- [ ] Make use of stroke and background color if available
- [ ] Ensure that contrast colors are in a reliable sequence; first dark then light
- [ ] Add cosine palettes again
